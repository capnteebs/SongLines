# SongLines

A graph-based music metadata visualization tool that lets you explore relationships between artists, tracks, albums, and labels.

## Features

### Graph Visualization

- **Multiple Layouts** — Switch between Force, Hierarchical, Circle, and Clustered layouts
- **Dynamic Node Sizing** — Nodes scale based on their connection count
- **Animated Drift** — Subtle organic movement keeps the graph feeling alive
- **Smart Labels** — Labels appear based on zoom level to reduce clutter

### Customization Options

#### Colors
Edit `src/style.css` to change the color scheme:
```css
:root {
  --accent-primary: #c44dff;   /* Main accent (purple) */
  --accent-secondary: #ff6b9d; /* Secondary accent (pink) */
  --accent-tertiary: #4d79ff;  /* Tertiary accent (blue) */
}
```

#### Node Colors
Edit `src/components/SongLines.vue`:
```typescript
const entityColors: Record<string, string> = {
  artist: '#ff6b9d',  // Pink
  track: '#c44dff',   // Purple
  album: '#4d79ff',   // Blue
  label: '#50c878',   // Green
}
```

#### Default Layout
Change the initial layout in `SongLines.vue`:
```typescript
const currentLayout = ref<'force' | 'hierarchical' | 'circle'>('force')
```

#### Sample Data
Replace `src/data/sampleData.ts` with your own data to change the default graph.

- 500+ nodes may require pausing drift animation
- 1000+ nodes recommended to disable animations
- WebGL acceleration used when available

## Troubleshooting

### Graph not loading
**Symptom:** Blank graph area, no nodes visible

**Solutions:**
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Ensure sample data exists in `src/data/sampleData.ts`
3. Try refreshing with cache clear (`Ctrl+Shift+R`)
4. Check if Cytoscape.js loaded correctly

### API errors
**Symptom:** "Failed to fetch" or CORS errors

**Solutions:**
1. **MusicBrainz:** Add proper User-Agent header (already configured)
2. **Deezer:** Uses CORS proxy; may hit rate limits
3. **Spotify:** Ensure redirect URI matches exactly
4. **Last.fm:** Verify API key is correct
5. **Apple Music:** Check JWT token hasn't expired

### Slow performance
**Symptom:** Laggy interactions, slow animations

**Solutions:**
1. Pause drift animation (⏸ button)
2. Switch to simpler layout (circle or hierarchical)
3. Filter out relationship types to reduce edges
4. Close other browser tabs
5. Disable mini-map on low-end devices

### Theme not persisting
**Symptom:** Theme resets on refresh

**Solutions:**
1. Check localStorage is enabled in browser
2. Not in private/incognito mode
3. Clear localStorage and try again:
   ```javascript
   localStorage.removeItem('SongLines-prefs')
   ```

### Import failing
**Symptom:** "Invalid graph data format" error

**Solutions:**
1. Ensure JSON has both `entities` and `relationships` arrays
2. Check all entities have `id`, `name`, and `type`
3. Check all relationships have `id`, `source`, `target`, and `role`
4. Validate JSON syntax at [jsonlint.com](https://jsonlint.com)

## FAQ

**Q: Can I use this with my own music data?**
A: Yes! Use the Import feature to load any JSON file matching the data format, or modify `sampleData.ts` directly.

**Q: Is the Spotify integration real?**
A: The integration code is complete, but you need to add your own Spotify Client ID and set up OAuth. The "Now Playing" bar in the demo is a mock.

**Q: Why does the graph keep moving?**
A: That's the "drift" animation for a more organic feel. Click the ⏸ button in the controls to pause it.

**Q: Can I embed this in another website?**
A: Yes, build the app and host it, then use an iframe. Or import the Vue components directly into your Vue project.

**Q: How do I add custom relationship types?**
A: Edit `src/types/music.ts` to add new role types, then update the color mappings in `SongLines.vue` and `EntityPanel.vue`.

**Q: Does this work offline?**
A: Yes, the core app works offline. API integrations require internet, but imported JSON data works offline.

**Q: Can I use this commercially?**
A: Yes, MIT license allows commercial use. Note that API data may have its own licensing terms.

**Q: How do I contribute?**
A: See the Contributing section below!
